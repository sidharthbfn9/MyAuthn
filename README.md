# MyAuthn
Overview
MyAuthn is a possible clone of Authn by Okta. Authn is responsible for authentication and authorization. This project will be able to clone some not all functionalities related to authentication and role based authorization.

MyAuthn is a SaaS based application which can be deployed on premises or on a centrally located server. It will support onboarding of multiple tenants/applications/users. These applications must be user centric where a user is trying to access some resource and the application is willingly trying to authenticate the user.

A user trying to access an onboarded application will be redirected to the register/login page pointing to MyAuthn. Post successful authentication, users can interact with applications fruitfully.

Application can also interact with MyAuthn real time for authenticating a user or refreshing the token.
